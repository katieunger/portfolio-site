Kanit means mathematics.
Kanit is a formal loopless Thai and Sans Latin typeface. 
It is a combination of Humanist Sans Serif with a curve of Capsulated Geometric style that suits for various usage in the present or even in the future. 
It was designed to have a 90 degree terminal in order to decrease spacing between each letter, but preserve readability and legibility even in a small point size.

A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, and ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

Formal loopless Thai tyefaces are simplified from a conservative looped Thai so this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the character.

Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.

<a href="http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/">TTFAutohint</a> was used to hint these fonts, as it now supports Thai. 
It is an easy-to-use tool that is highly recommended.
